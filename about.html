<div class="ABOUT">
<P>
	Color Me Stoke (Alex) and Jo-Flash 6.7 (Jonah) have been close friends since High School and have been videos on thier personal YouTube channels based around thier special interests for almost since middle school. Eventually when they became best friends they began making a small series that Jo-Flash came up that gain them some decent atttention in small internet community. This would lead to them launching their new collaborative channel "FlashStoke Productions" where they would work together make all kinds of new content aside from thier series.
