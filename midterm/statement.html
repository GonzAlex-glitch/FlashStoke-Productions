		When I decided to based my project around the world of one of my favorite shows growing up, I wanted to make sure I made up a site that had a very bubbly and fun vibe that captures the same feeling of the show. For the main page and overall look for the page I wanted to do something simple but still unqiue in it's own way where each page will have 2 characters in top doing a looping see-saw animation moving back and forth. I also figure giving the page a boarder in the middle with background of the map of Equestria. It felt better than making it the main background cause when I tried to I just ended up looking very askew and abstract which is very distracting. So I went ahead with a border where the map will actually appear as a background along with placeholding all the text featured.

		With that in mind I also wanted to give each of the borders, buttons, and fonts to have a round circular style fitting with the show's iconic logo. Although fonts were quite the hardnest thing to handle mainly due to how when looking through Google Webfonts Helper fonts there were were alot of fonts that haf the bubbly and round aesthetic I was looking for aside from the already used "Cherry Bomb One". That was when I realized that maybe not everything has to be stylized that way since some of the credit and sub-credit text from the show used a bit of a more cursive and times new roman feel so I went with Bubblegum Sans. I even gave the paragraphs and headers an outline to contrast from thier repective backgrounds.
