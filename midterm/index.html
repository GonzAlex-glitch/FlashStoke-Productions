		The student Twilight Sparkle would end up meeting some unique characters in the one of lovely cities in Equestria known as ponyville she had doubts about them at first for she wasn't interested at all in making friends at all. But these 5 ponies would welcome her in open arms and gifts showing off thier laughter, loyalty, honesty, kindness, and generosity. Together these 6 would becomes the daily heroes who woudl save the day on the daily, show civilains the power of thier elements, and eventually lead the next generation of Equestria.
